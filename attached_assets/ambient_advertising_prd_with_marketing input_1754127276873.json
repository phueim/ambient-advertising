  "replit_ai_prompt": "\nBuild a modular CMS workflow for the Ambient Advertising Management System with the following requirements:\n\n1. Configurable Billing & Payout Models\n   - Support multiple models assignable per contract:\n     - Fixed monthly fees\n     - Per-trigger/event-based charges\n     - Percentage-based revenue sharing\n     - Hybrid combinations (e.g., fixed + percentage, or monthly base + per-trigger)\n   - Allow configuration without backend code changes.\n\n2. Dashboards & User Views\n   - Advertiser Dashboard: Show budget, credits, triggers delivered, utilization, and spend history in real time.\n   - Venue Dashboard: Show earnings, payout schedule, and advertiser contribution breakdown.\n   - Admin Dashboard: Show all contracts, total advertiser spend, venue payouts, profit margins, and system health.\n\n3. Automation & Tracking\n   - Deduct advertiser credits automatically when triggers occur.\n   - Log all triggers and billing actions in real time for audit and reporting.\n   - Fallback to default ads when credits are exhausted or no condition is met.\n   - Alerts for thresholds (e.g., low advertiser credits, venue payout due).\n\n4. Scalability & Compliance\n   - Must support hundreds of advertisers and venues concurrently.\n   - Maintain audit logs for every trigger, payout, and credit deduction.\n   - Role-based access: admin, advertiser, and venue partner.\n   - Ensure compliance with PDPA/GDPR.\n\n5. Contract Assignment\n   - Admin can assign billing/payout models per advertiser and venue.\n   - Contract fields should include:\n     - Advertiser billing model & parameters (budget, per-trigger rate, subscription fee).\n     - Venue payout model & parameters (fixed fee, % share, per-trigger payout).\n   - Contract logic must flow directly into dashboards and reporting.\n\n6. Analytics & Reporting\n   - Advertisers: triggers delivered, cost per trigger, ROI insights.\n   - Venues: earnings, payout breakdown, performance trends.\n   - Admin: aggregated revenue, profit margins, credit utilization, and system performance.\n\nGoal: Deliver a scalable, auditable, and automated CMS for contextual advertising campaigns in FMCG, retail, and F&B venues, ensuring maximum flexibility in billing and payout structures.\n"
